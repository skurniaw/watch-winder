# watch-winder

This is code for a mechanical watch winder for Arduino. This code imports libraries for a DS3231 real-time clock as well as for a simple stepper motor (AccelStepper). The DS3231 library can be found on the Adafruit Arduino repository and the AccelStepper library can be found at this link (https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/) In the code you are able to specify how long the motor turns in one direction, as well as the delay in between the motor running. 

Enjoy!
