# watch-winder

This is code for a mechanical watch winder for Arduino. This code imports libraries for a DS3231 real-time clock as well as for a simple stepper motor (AccelStepper). In the code you are able to specify how long the motor turns in one direction, as well as the delay in between the motor running. 

Thank you!
